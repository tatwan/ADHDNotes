# ADHDNotes

A local-first Electron desktop application for ADHD users that combines **markdown** note-taking with calendar integration, **offline bookmarking with content preservation**, and implements forced daily task prioritization through intentional friction.

### **Calendar (Daily) Notes: Task and Time Blocks**

* Notes associated with the calendar

### **General Notes** 

* Create non-calendar dependent notes (like any note taking tool)
* All your notes are locally stored 
* Full Markdown support 
* Switch Themes and apply your own CSS theme

### **Bookmarks & Offline Content**

Save web articles, documentation, and resources directly into ADHDNotes with full offline access:

- **Browser Extension Integration** - Save bookmarks from any website with a single click via the Chrome/Firefox extension
- **Content Preservation** - Full article content extracted and stored locally using Mozilla Readability
- **Offline Access** - Read saved content even without internet connection
- **AI-Powered Tags** - Automatic tag generation to organize your bookmarks
- **Local Asset Storage** - Images and favicons stored locally for complete offline experience
- **Rich Metadata** - Automatically extracts title, description, and Open Graph data
- **SQLite Database** - Fast, reliable local storage with full-text search capabilities

</p>

The bookmarks feature runs a local Fastify API server (port 3666) that communicates with the browser extension, ensuring your data never leaves your machine.

### **Daily Task Migration**

Tomorrow when you open the app, if you have incomplete tasks from today, you'll see a modal:

**"Review Yesterday's Tasks"**

You MUST review each task:

- **Move to Today** - Task gets copied to today's note
- **Not Important** - Task is dismissed

This is **intentional**! It forces you to:

- Reflect on what actually matters
- Avoid endless task accumulation
- Make conscious prioritization decisions

You cannot skip this - every task requires a decision.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
- Launch Electron with hot reload enabled
- Start local API server on http://localhost:3666 (for browser extension)
- Open DevTools automatically (optional)

## Browser Extension Installation

To use the Bookmarks and Snippets features, you need to install the browser extension:

### Building the Extension

1. Navigate to the extension directory:
```bash
cd extension
```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates the extension files in `extension/dist/`.

### Installing in Chrome/Edge

1. Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Edge: `edge://extensions/`

2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)

3. Click **Load unpacked**

4. Select the `extension/dist` folder

5. The ADHDNotes extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Using the Extension

Once installed, you can:

- **Save Bookmarks**: Right-click on any page → "Save to ADHDNotes"
- **Save Snippets**: Highlight text → Right-click → "Add as Snippet"

**Note**: The ADHDNotes desktop app must be running for the extension to work (it communicates via localhost:3666).

### Updating the Extension

After making changes to the extension code:

1. Rebuild: `cd extension && npm run build`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon (🔄) on the ADHDNotes extension card

## Building

Build the application for distribution:

```bash
npm run electron:build
```

This will create distributable packages in the `release/` directory for:
- **macOS**: DMG installer and .app bundle
- **Windows**: NSIS installer and portable .exe
- **Linux**: AppImage, .deb, and .rpm

## Notes Directory Structure

On first launch, the app creates this structure in your Documents folder:

```
~/Documents/ADHDNotes/
├── daily/
│   ├── 2025-10-25.md
│   ├── 2025-10-26.md
│   └── 2025-10-27.md
├── Notes/
│   ├── Work/
│   │   ├── Project Alpha.md
│   │   └── Sprint Planning.md
│   └── Personal/
│       └── Goals 2025.md
├── themes/
│   ├── default-light.css
│   └── default-dark.css
├── bookmarks.db          # SQLite database for bookmarks
└── assets/              # Downloaded images and favicons
    ├── favicon-1.png
    └── image-2.jpg
```

## Markdown Syntax

### Tasks
```markdown
* [ ] Incomplete task
* [x] Completed task
  * [ ] Subtask (indented with 2 spaces)
```

### Time Blocks
```markdown
+ [ ] Time block without time
+ [ ] 09:00 Team meeting (with scheduled time)
+ [x] 14:00 Code review (completed time block)
```

### Scheduling Tasks
You can drag tasks from the editor to specific time slots in the timeline. The task will be updated with the scheduled time:
```markdown
* [ ] 10:00 Task scheduled for 10 AM
```

### Preview Mode
Toggle between editing and preview mode using the eye icon button or keyboard shortcut `Cmd+/` (macOS) or `Ctrl+/` (Windows/Linux):
- **Edit Mode**: Raw markdown with syntax highlighting
- **Preview Mode**: Beautiful rendered view with styled headings, lists, checkboxes, code blocks, and more

Preview mode shows:
- Formatted headings with borders
- Clickable checkboxes for tasks (read-only in preview)
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Styled blockquotes, tables, and lists
- Links, images, and horizontal rules

### Calendar Date Indicators
The calendar shows blue dots on dates that have notes, making it easy to see which days you've been productive!

## Core Feature: Forced Daily Migration

When you navigate to a new day, if there are incomplete tasks from the previous day, you'll see a modal that blocks the app until you process each task. This is **intentional friction** designed to help ADHD users:

- **No "skip" button** - You must review your tasks
- **Flexible processing** - Review tasks individually or use bulk actions
- **Per-task choices**:
  - **Move to Today** - Copy task to today's note
  - **Not Important** - Dismiss the task
- **Bulk actions available**:
  - **Move All** - Move all remaining tasks to today at once
  - **Ignore All** - Dismiss all remaining tasks at once

You can choose to review each task individually (allowing you to move some and ignore others), or use the bulk actions to quickly process all remaining tasks. This provides flexibility while still requiring conscious engagement with your task backlog.

## Settings

Settings are stored in `electron-store` and include:
- Theme (light/dark/system)
- Editor font size
- Timeline start/end hours
- Auto-save interval
- Window dimensions
- Last reviewed date (for migration tracking)

## Development Tips

1. **Hot Reload**: Changes to React code will hot reload. Electron main process changes require app restart.

2. **Debugging**:
   - Renderer process: Use DevTools (opens automatically in dev mode)
   - Main process: Use `console.log()` - output appears in terminal

3. **File System**: All file operations go through IPC for security. See `electron/main.ts` for available IPC handlers.

4. **State Management**: Use Zustand stores instead of prop drilling. Stores are reactive and automatically update components.

## Security

- Context isolation enabled
- No Node.js integration in renderer
- All file operations validated to stay within notes directory
- Local API server (port 3666) only accepts connections from localhost
- No external network access - all data stays on your machine
- Bookmarks database encrypted at rest (optional)

## Future Features

- Google Calendar integration
- Microsoft Calendar integration
- Full-text search across notes and bookmarks
- Browser extension for Chrome and Firefox (in beta)
- Bookmark collections and advanced filtering
- Markdown export for bookmarks
- PDF export for notes
- Mobile companion app
- Cloud sync (optional, encrypted)
